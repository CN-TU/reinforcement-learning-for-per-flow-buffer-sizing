	abstract = {CUBIC is a congestion control protocol for TCP (transmission control protocol) and the current default TCP algorithm in Linux. The protocol modiﬁes the linear window growth function of existing TCP standards to be a cubic function in order to improve the scalability of TCP over fast and long distance networks. It also achieves more equitable bandwidth allocations among ﬂows with diﬀerent RTTs (round trip times) by making the window growth to be independent of RTT – thus those ﬂows grow their congestion window at the same rate. During steady state, CUBIC increases the window size aggressively when the window is far from the saturation point, and the slowly when it is close to the saturation point. This feature allows CUBIC to be very scalable when the bandwidth and delay product of the network is large, and at the same time, be highly stable and also fair to standard TCP ﬂows. The implementation of CUBIC in Linux has gone through several upgrades. This paper documents its design, implementation, performance and evolution as the default TCP algorithm of Linux.},

	abstract = {Detecting and handling network congestion in the Internet has, again, become a vital area of research. The provisioning of low latency together with high throughput is of particular interest due to the current mix of applications running in the Internet. Active Queue Management (AQM) mechanisms come with the promise of reducing queuing delays. They, however, may adversely affect throughput and network utilization and have proven to be difficult to configure. More recent AQMs, such as CoDel, PIE, and GSP are easier to configure but work with a fixed target delay setpoint. Depending on the traffic the same setpoint value can result either in unnecessary large delays or under-utilization of the link. Policy-oriented AQM Steering automatically adapts the target delay setpoint to the current traffic situation, in order to fulfill a given quality-of-service policy. Such a policy consists of a utilization goal and an upper delay bound. This improves AQM performance with varying traffic situations and makes the impact of deploying an AQM predictable. A prototypical implementation of AQM Steering for GSP showed its performance advantages compared to static AQM variants at speeds of 10 Gbit/s and 1 Gbit/s.},

In this, a new active queue management (AQM) controller is proposed based on feed-forward neural network called (FFNN-AQM) to control the network congestion efﬁciently by stabilizing the queue length. It learns the trafﬁc pattern of the nonlinear and dynamic network and predicts the future value of current queue length. The parameters of neurons adjusted depending on the time-varying environment to stabilize the queue length. The NS2 network simulator is used to analyze the performance of FFNN-AQM along with existing techniques. The simulation experiment results demonstrate that FFNN-AQM is stable and achieve faster convergence with small settling time in varying network conditions. The proposed controller outperforms existing AQM proportional integral (PI), intelligent adaptive PI and neural network PI techniques.},

Conversely, applying this model-based approach to Active Queue Management (AQM) has so far received less attention. We propose the new AQM scheduler cocoa based on fair queuing, which adapts the buffer size depending on the needs of each flow without requiring active participation from the endpoint. We implement this scheduler for the Linux kernel and show that it interacts well with the most common congestion control algorithms and can significantly increase throughput compared to fair CoDel while avoiding overbuffering.},

Instead of using packet loss as congestion signal, like many currently used congestion controls, it uses an estimate of the available bottleneck link bandwidth to determine its sending rate. BBR tries to provide high link utilization while avoiding to create queues in bottleneck buffers. The original publication of BBR shows that it can deliver superior performance compared to Cubic TCP in some environments. This paper provides an independent and extensive experimental evaluation of BBR at higher speeds. The experimental setup uses BBR's Linux kernel 4.9 implementation and typical data rates of 10Gbit/s and 1 Gbit/s at the bottleneck link. The experiments vary the flows' round-trip times, the number of flows, and buffer sizes at the bottleneck. The evaluation considers throughput, queuing delay, packet loss, and fairness. On the one hand, the intended behavior of BBR could be observed with our experiments. On the other hand, some severe inherent issues such as increased queuing delays, unfairness, and massive packet loss were also detected. The paper provides an in-depth discussion of BBR's behavior in different experiment setups.},

	doi = {10.1109/INFCOM.2004.1354672},
	abstract = {High-speed networks with large delays present a unique environment where TCP may have a problem utilizing the full bandwidth. Several congestion control proposals have been suggested to remedy this problem. The existing protocols consider mainly two properties: TCP friendliness and bandwidth scalability. That is, a protocol should not take away too much bandwidth from standard TCP flows while utilizing the full bandwidth of high-speed networks. This work presents another important constraint, namely, RTT (round trip time) unfairness where competing flows with different RTTs may consume vastly unfair bandwidth shares. Existing schemes have a severe RTT unfairness problem because the congestion window increase rate gets larger as the window grows ironically the very reason that makes them more scalable. RTT unfairness for high-speed networks occurs distinctly with drop tail routers for flows with large congestion windows where packet loss can be highly synchronized. After identifying the RTT unfairness problem of existing protocols, This work presents a new congestion control scheme that alleviates RTT unfairness while supporting TCP friendliness and bandwidth scalability. The proposed congestion control algorithm uses two window size control policies called additive increase and binary search increase. When the congestion window is large, additive increase with a large increment ensures square RTT unfairness as well as good scalability. Under small congestion windows, binary search increase supports TCP friendliness. The simulation results confirm these properties of the protocol.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1809.03486},
	abstract = {The efficiency of numerous proposed flow-oriented networking mechanisms strongly depends on traffic characteristics and should thus be assessed using accurate models. For example, in the case of algorithms, which are based on the distinction between elephant and mice flows, it is extremely important to ensure realistic flows' length (in packets) and size (in bytes) distributions. Credible models or data are not available in literature. Numerous works contain only plots roughly presenting empirical probability density functions and cumulative distribution functions of selected flow parameters, however, none of these papers provide distribution mixture models or reusable numerical data. This paper aims to fill that gap and provide accurate and reusable models of flow length and size derived from real traffic traces. Traces were collected at the Internet-facing interface of the university campus network and comprise four billion flow (275 TB of transmitted data). These models can be used to assess a variety of flow-oriented solutions under the assumption of realistic conditions. Additionally, this paper provides a complete tutorial on constructing network flow models from traffic traces. The proposed methodology is universal and can be applied to traffic traces gathered in any network. Apart from the methodology, we also provide an open source software framework which make it possible to analyze flow traces and fit general mixture models to them. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that provides such a universal methodology together with fully a usable software framework.},

The purpose of these controllers is to manage the network congestion under varying loads, link delays and bandwidth. In this paper, a new AQM controller is proposed which is trained by using the SVM (Support Vector Machine) with the RBF (Radial Basis Function) kernal. The proposed controller is called the support vector based AQM (SAM) controller. The performance of the proposed controller has been compared with three conventional AQM controllers, namely the Random Early Detection, Blue and Proportional Plus Integral Controller. The preliminary simulation studies show that the performance of the proposed controller is comparable to the conventional controllers. However, the proposed controller is more efficient in controlling the queue size than the conventional controllers.},

In order to increase exploitation of network resources wisely, intelligent adaptive solutions for class based traffic regulation are needed. In particular, active queue management (AQM) is regarded as one of these solutions to provide low queuing delay and high throughput to flows by smart packet discarding. In this paper, we propose a novel AQM solution for future all-IP networks based on a reinforcement learning scheme that allows controlling both the queuing delay and the packet loss of the different service classes.

	abstract = {Wireless networks are undergoing an unprecedented revolution in the last decade. With the explosion of delay-sensitive applications usage on the Internet (i.e., online gaming, VoIP, and safety-critical applications), latency becomes a major issue for the development of wireless technology since it has an enormous impact on user experience. In fact, in a phenomenon known as bufferbloat, large static buffers inside the network devices results in increasing the time that packets spend in the queues and, thus, causing larger delays. Concerns have arisen about designing efficient queue management schemes to mitigate the effects of over-buffering in wireless devices. In this paper, we advocate the exploitation of machine learning techniques for dynamic buffer sizing. We propose LearnQueue, a novel reinforcement learning design that can effectively control the latency in wireless networks. LearnQueue adapts quickly and intelligently to changes in the wireless environment using a sophisticated reward structure. The latency control is performed dynamically by tuning the buffer size. Adopting a trial-and-error approach, the proposed scheme penalizes the actions resulting in longer delays or hurting the throughput. In addition, the scheme parameters are designed for an optimized operation depending on different applications requirements. Using the latest generation of WARP hardware, we investigated LearnQueue performance in various network scenarios. The testbed results prove that LearnQueue can grantee low latency while preserving throughput under various congestion situations. We also discuss the feasibility and possible limitations of large-scale deployment of the proposed scheme in wireless devices.},

	abstract = {Active queue management (AQM) techniques have evolved in the recent years, after defining the bufferbloat problem. In parallel novel congestion control (CC) algorithms have been developed to achieve better data transport performance, often assuming simple tail dropping buffers. On the other hand, AQM algorithms usually assume legacy CC (Cubic). Though all of the novel AQM and CC algorithms improve the performance under these assumptions, their co-existence has not or only partially been tested so far. Similarly, router buffer sizing was studied mainly in the 2000s, also assuming traditional CC and tail dropping buffers. In this paper we show that combining the different AQMs and CCs evolved in the past few years results in poor fairness, because assumptions used during development do not hold in this heterogeneous case. We also show that while a non-traditional AQM, using core-stateless resource sharing control, has the potential to harmonize conflicting CCs, it suffers from deployment issues. We argue that when dimensioning router buffers in networks where connections with different CCs coexist, the right choice of AQM is more important than the size of the buffer itself.},

The provisioning of low latency together with high throughput is of particular interest due to the current mix of applications running in the Internet. Active Queue Management (AQM) mechanisms come with the promise of reducing queuing delays. They, however, may adversely affect throughput and network utilization and have proven to be difficult to configure. More recent AQMs, such as CoDel, PIE, and GSP are easier to configure but work with a fixed target delay setpoint. Depending on the traffic the same setpoint value can result either in unnecessary large delays or under-utilization of the link. Policy-oriented AQM Steering automatically adapts the target delay setpoint to the current traffic situation, in order to fulfill a given quality-of-service policy. Such a policy consists of a utilization goal and an upper delay bound. This improves AQM performance with varying traffic situations and makes the impact of deploying an AQM predictable. A prototypical implementation of AQM Steering for GSP showed its performance advantages compared to static AQM variants at speeds of 10 Gbit/s and 1 Gbit/s.},

	abstract = {In addition to classic ones, a new family of congestion controls regarded as “scalable” has recently emerged. Scalable congestion control exploits ECN to provide much ﬁner control as rate scales, enabling reactions proportional to the congestion level. Nowadays, different initiatives propose the use of Scalable congestion control over the public Internet, with the separation of Scalable and Classic ﬂows. Similar to classic approaches, the evolution of Scalable congestion control has also begun as BBRv2 implemented a “DCTCP-inspired” ECN mechanism. In this paper, we investigate the compatibility of two available Scalable congestion controls, Data Center TCP, and Google’s recent proposal called BBRv2, and evaluate them with different ECN marking strategies. Our evaluation relies on numerous measurements carried out in our testbed with 1 to 10Gbps bottleneck capacities and heterogeneous round trip times. At the bottleneck, the ECN marking of two traditional AQMs (STEP and PI2) most commonly proposed for Scalable ﬂows and a non-traditional core-stateless AQM (CSAQM) using in-network resource sharing control is examined. After showing compatibility issues, we conclude that as long as the end-to-end ﬂows control resource sharing, it will be tough to create a new, evolved congestion control that is fair to legacy solutions, and its deployment does not harm the Internet.},

The most important key performance indicators (KPIs) related to URLLC are latency, reliability and availability. In this paper, after brief discussion on the design challenges related to URLLC use cases, we present an overview of the available technology components from 3GPP Rel-15 and potential ones from Rel-16. In addition, coordinated multi-cell resource allocation methods are studied. From the system level simulation results in an urban macro environment, it can be observed that effective multi-cell cooperation, more specifically soft combining, can lead to a significant gain in terms of URLLC capacity.},

They allow determining if a flow is malicious or not already before it is over, making it possible to take action immediately. However, considering the large number of packets that has to be inspected, for example in cloud/fog and edge computing, the question of computational efficiency arises. We show that by using a novel Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based approach called SparseIDS, we can reduce the number of consumed packets by more than three fourths while keeping classification accuracy high. To minimize the computational expenses of the RL-based sampling we show that a shared neural network can be used for both the classifier and the RL logic. Thus, no additional resources are consumed by the sampling in deployment. Comparing to various other sampling techniques, SparseIDS consistently achieves higher classification accuracy by learning to sample only relevant packets. A major novelty of our RL-based approach is that it can not only skip up to a predefined maximum number of samples like other approaches proposed in the domain of Natural Language Processing but can even skip arbitrarily many packets in one step. This enables saving even more computational resources for long sequences. Inspecting SparseIDS's behavior of choosing packets shows that it adopts different sampling strategies for different attack types and network flows. Finally we build an automatic steering mechanism that can guide SparseIDS in deployment to achieve a desired level of sparsity.},

	abstract = {Modern communication networks have become very complicated and highly dynamic, which makes them hard to model, predict and control. In this paper, we develop a novel experience-driven approach that can learn to well control a communication network from its own experience rather than an accurate mathematical model, just as a human learns a new skill (such as driving, swimming, etc). Specifically, we, for the first time, propose to leverage emerging Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) for enabling model-free control in communication networks; and present a novel and highly effective DRL-based control framework, DRL-TE, for a fundamental networking problem: Traffic Engineering (TE). The proposed framework maximizes a widely-used utility function by jointly learning network environment and its dynamics, and making decisions under the guidance of powerful Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). We propose two new techniques, TE-aware exploration and actor-critic-based prioritized experience replay, to optimize the general DRL framework particularly for TE. To validate and evaluate the proposed framework, we implemented it in ns-3, and tested it comprehensively with both representative and randomly generated network topologies. Extensive packet-level simulation results show that 1) compared to several widely-used baseline methods, DRL-TE significantly reduces end-to-end delay and consistently improves the network utility, while offering better or comparable throughput; 2) DRL-TE is robust to network changes; and 3) DRL-TE consistently outperforms a state-of-the-art DRL method (for continuous control), Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG), which, however, does not offer satisfying performance.},
